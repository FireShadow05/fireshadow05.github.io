### Abstract 
###### [Arxiv Pre-Print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12608#:~:text=Trust%2C%20But%20Verify%3A%20A%20Survey%20of%20Randomized%20Smoothing%20Techniques,-Anupriya%20Kumari%2C%20Devansh&text=Machine%20learning%20models%20have%20demonstrated,emerge%2C%20rendering%20existing%20defences%20obsolete.)
Machine learning models have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Empirical defence mechanisms often fall short, as new attacks constantly emerge, rendering existing defences obsolete. A paradigm shift from empirical defences to certification-based defences has been observed in response. Randomized smoothing has emerged as a promising technique among notable advancements. This study reviews the theoretical foundations, empirical effectiveness, and applications of randomized smoothing in verifying machine learning classifiers. We provide an in-depth exploration of the fundamental concepts underlying randomized smoothing, highlighting its theoretical guarantees in certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we discuss existing methodologies' current challenges and offer insightful perspectives on potential solutions. This paper is novel in its attempt to systemise the existing knowledge in the context of randomised smoothing.
